This repository contains a data mining project for "Confectionaries Are US", aimed at understanding the factors influencing profitability across multiple countries. The project follows a structured approach to data preparation, analysis, and modeling using Python.

Project Structure.

The project is divided into four key scripts, each serving a distinct purpose:
1. Data_preprocessing.py script
Purpose: Prepares raw data for analysis by handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
2. Star_Schema.py script
Purpose: Organizes pre-processed data into a star schema with fact and dimension tables.
3. Descriptive_Statistics.py script.
   Purpose: Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and computes descriptive statistics.
4. Linear_Regression.py script
Purpose: Builds Linear Regression model to predict profitability.
To execute this project on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:

2. Ensure Python (3.x) is installed on your system.
3. Install necessary libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels
4. Run each script in order:
   - Data_Preprocessing.py.
   - Star_Schema.py.
   - Descriptive_Statistics.py.
   - Linear_Regression.py.
